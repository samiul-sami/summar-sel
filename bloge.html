            <p>
                var: Function-scoped, hoisted, and can be used before declaration. <br>
                let: Block-scoped, not hoisted, and cannot be used before declaration. <br>
                const: Block-scoped, not hoisted, and used for values that should not be reassigned (though it's not necessarily immutable for objects and arrays).</p>

            <p>
               
           null:  Used to represent an intentional absence of value. <br>
           undefined: Typically indicates uninitialized variables, non-existent properties, or missing function arguments in JavaScript.</p>

            <p>
                A REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, 
                is a type of web service that follows a set of architectural principles for designing networked applications.
                 It uses standard HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) to perform operations on resources, 
                 which are identified by unique URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). REST APIs are known for their simplicity, 
                 scalability, and statelessness, making them a popular choice for building web applications and services.</p>
